# Matterport Showcase Settings Playground

The Settings Namespace allows developers access to internal settings within Showcase. These internal settings are unsupported and may change. This playground will allow developers to experiment with all known settings.

This example was created as both a resource and an exercize in building a simple one-page React Application to demonstrate integration of the Matterport SDK for Embeds with React.

All settings in this application can be used with the Matterport Showcase SDK via `Settings.update('[setting name',value);`
